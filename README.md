# DESCRIPTION :clipboard:

 Pitch app helps in the introduction of ideas to others in the shortest time possible.Most probably a minute wont hurt if one was able to talk to you in that one minute and give you a good idea even when you was as busy as buble bees :honeybee: buzzing around the sunflower's florents :sunflower: for nectar.
 That one minute can change your life and thus the app gives you the platform to tell the world about your ideas in just a minute.
