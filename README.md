# DESCRIPTION

 Pitch app helps in the introduction of ideas to others in the shortest time possible.Most probably a minute wont hurt if one was able to talk to you in that one minute and give you a good idea even when you was as busy as buble bees buzzing around the sunflower's florents for nectar.
 That one minute can change your life and thus the app gives you the platform to tell the world about your ideas in just a minute.
